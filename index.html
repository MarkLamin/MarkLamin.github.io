  <h2 class="featurette-heading">About </h2>
  <p class="lead" style="font-size: 24px">
I am a second-year M.S. student in Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health,
    focusing on interpretable statistical modeling with applications in molecular biology and public health.
    Additionally, I'm interested in mathematical and computational statistics.
<br/>
<br/>
In Summer 2024, I served as a Senior Data Scientist Intern at Tactile Medical,
    where I developed interactive web apps to support data-driven decision-making for marketing teams and stakeholders.
<br/>
<br/>
This academic year, I am contributing to the University of Minnesota Genomic Data Commons Project under Dr. Saonli Basu.
    Previously, I conducted research under Dr. Sandra Safo and Dr. Thierry Chekouo on multi-omics data integration for Alzheimer's progression characterization.
    Before my M.S. program, I worked on implementing spectral clustering methods for multi-omics data as a fellow at the Colorado Summer Institute in Biostatistics (CoSIBS).
<br/>
<br/>
I am also passionate about education, having served in a variety of educational roles including math teaching and tutoring, 
    and working as a Technical Trainer at Epic Systems Corporation.
    In Fall 2024, I am a Teaching Assistant for PubH 7405, leading lab sessions in statistics, linear algebra, and R programming for M.S. and Ph.D. students.
